# SocialBlock

## **Problem** 
Web2 social media, which is the current mainstream model, is characterized by centralized platforms that have control over user data and content. Following are some problems highlighting the limitations of web2 social media : \
Lack of User Control\
Data Privacy Concerns\
Content Moderation Challenges\ 
Lack of Transparency and Trust\
Centralized Authority\
Incentives Misalignment\ 
Limited Interoperability

## **Solution Proposed :**
We have created a Web3 Socail Media App called **SOCIAL-BLOCK**
Use of Web3 social media offers potential benefits such as user-controlled data, content, and platform rules, greater transparency and trust, decentralized moderation, incentives alignment, and interoperability across different platforms. Users will have more control over their personal information, can verify the authenticity of content, and can participate in decision-making through decentralized governance as a result generating solution to above mentioned problem. \

### **Technologies used:**
